Try problems in https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html if you need a formal tutorial in Python. Personally, I recommend not looking at the solutions, just at the problems, and google-ing the syntax you need. There is no substitute for playing around with the code trying things out\n","2. Run each cell by clicking on cell then go to Cell->Run cells. \n","3. The purpose of this tutorial is NOT learning algorithms, it's just to be able to use python. I've selected a few problems from other places that I feel cover python basics. \n","4. I recommend NOT reading the solutions first. Please try to solve everything on your own (which means you can google syntax). I want everyone to learn to be able to figure Pythonic syntax out as independently as possible. That being said, if you struggle, please post on Learn / office hours\n","5. Notice an advantage of Jupyter here. I can make my code look much prettier than in a normal file right? This cell I'm typing in is called \"Markdown\" type and it lets me organize my code by headings, put in thoughts & ideas separate from code\n","6.
